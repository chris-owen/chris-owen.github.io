# Personal website of Christopher L. Owen

This is my first attempt at making a github pages website. I think I have
wrapped my head around it. Until I add a bit more content, I am going to use the
README.md doc as a to-do list until I get things to where I want them.

- [x] Add informative figures to the front page regarding research topics.
- [ ] Add a blurb to the *About me*
- [ ] Add current CV
- [ ] Add content to each of the highlighted research topics. This includes converting figures (graphs and phylogenies) to javascript using [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org) to insert in the appropriate pages.
